# Social Network Graph

> Representing Instagram users and exploring the connections between them 
> by presenting them in an interactive graph.


The work of many programs and applications is based on the analysis of data 
received from users, as well as on their interactions with each other, which 
allows developers to create a more convenient program that adapts to the user 
according to his preferences, and so on. Our project is a branch of this topic.
