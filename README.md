# Social Network Graph

> Representing Instagram users and exploring the connections between them 
> by presenting them in an interactive graph.

The work of many programs and applications is based on the analysis of data 
received from users, as well as on their interactions with each other, which 
allows developers to create a more convenient program that adapts to the user 
according to his preferences, and so on. Our project is a branch of this topic.

Our project aims to analyze connections between users by visualizing them in a 
graph, thus allowing users to see their audience and how it is connected to the 
audience of our friends in the social network. 

We provide opportunities such as:
* finding common acquaintances,
* tracking certain connections,
* increasing socialization.

We present the project as a site where the user will be able to enter a certain 
nickname and trace the user's connections with other people with the help of 
the graph, which will be generated.
